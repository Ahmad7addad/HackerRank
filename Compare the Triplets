Question

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet A(a0,a1,a2) , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet B(b0,b1,b2).

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing  with ,  with , and  with .

If a(i)>b(i), then Alice is awarded  point.
If a(i)<b(i), then Bob is awarded  point.
If a(i)=b(i), then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given A and B, can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, a0 , a1 , and a2, describing the respective values in triplet A. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers, b0, b1 , and b2, describing the respective values in triplet B.
